## About
This webapp was developed at <NWL/> Together/2021 Week organized by [Rocket Seat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) in the ReactJS track.

It  creates rooms so that questions can be asked, marked as favorite by audience, highlited and marked as answered by moderator.
It was build thinking on remote interaction, such as lives, where the audience can make a question and the moderator has a tool to organize such questions and answer them.
